During spring 2020, we wanted to make the best of our time in lockdown. Thus, along with two of my colleagues, Dr Aaron Weimann and Dr Chris Ruis, we decided to organise a bioinformatics course to train our wet lab mates in R. Moreover, I already had good material from the course I taught the previous year in Mexico. The main thing was to translate it into English. You can read more about it in my previous post.
The lessons that I was in charge were introduction to R and statistical analysis. You can find the slides [here](../files/R_worskshop_introENG.pdf) and [here](../files/R_worskshop_Statistics_analysisENG.pdf). You can also find the full course [here](https://aweimann.github.io/floto-lab-learning-bioinformatics/docs/).

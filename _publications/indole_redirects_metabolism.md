This work was producing during my time at Summers Lab. In this study, we examined the effect of indole on the anaerobic metabolism of E. coli. We added indole in to the culture medium and compared cell growth, hydrogen, and metabolite production to cultures lacking indole. Our results showed that a high indole dose had a partial bacteriostatic effect and increased hydrogen production and yield. This can be explained because the nutriets stop flowing towards biomass but the hydrogen production path keeps active.

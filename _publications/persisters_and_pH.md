One of  most impressive featatures of bacteria is their ability to develop resistance to antibiotics, rendering these life-saving drugs ineffective. In this study developed in collaboration with some colleagues at the Uni of Exeter (Pagliara Lab), we investigate some the dynamics of intracellular pH in individual bacterja cells in response to ampicillin treatment. The main focus is at the modelling of sub-populations based on their cytoplasmic pH and their different survival dynamics.

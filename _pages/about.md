* I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [BoeckLab](https://biomedizin.unibas.ch/en/research/research-groups/boeck-lab/). There, I am developing a Deep learning image analysis pipeline to track antibiotic killing with microscopy.
* My research interest lies broadly in the intersection between machine learning models, causal inference, and infectious diseases. I dig into complex datasets to find meaningful patterns, which I then convey using the power of metaphor and aesthetic visuals.
* I recently completed my PhD at Flotolab where I employed cutting edege microfluidic devices coupled with advance ML detection and tracking techniques to show the coordination of bacterial metabolism and membrane permeability. In a nutshell, my findings suggest that bacteria cannot "eat" and "breathe" at the same time.
* Prior to this, I obtained my MSc on Molecular Biology & Biotechnology at [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en) where I receive the Honours Collegue. Before that, I did my Bachelor at the [Univeridad Autónoma de Madrid](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio).
* Beyond my interest in ML and infectious diseases, I am also very interested in the application of new language ML models in the field of meta-analysis and meta-research.

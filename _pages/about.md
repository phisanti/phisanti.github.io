* I am a research associate at [Heart & Lung Research Institute, University of Cambridge](https://royalpapworth.nhs.uk/research-and-development/hlri). I am currently developing infection models for lung-on-chip in a joint project between [Prof. Clare Bryant](https://www.immunology.cam.ac.uk/Networkdirectory/ceb27@cam.ac.uk), [Prof. Andres Floto](https://www.flotolab.com/) and [Dr Pietro Cicuta](https://people.bss.phy.cam.ac.uk/~pc245/).
* My research interest lies broadly in the intersection between machine learning models, causal inference, and infectious diseases. I dig into complex datasets to find meaningful patterns, which I then convey using the power of metaphor and aesthetic visuals.
* I recently completed my PhD at Flotolab where I employed cutting edege microfluidic devices coupled with advance ML detection and tracking techniques to show the coordination of bacterial metabolism and membrane permeability. In a nutshell, my findings suggest that bacteria cannot "eat" and "breathe" at the same time.
* Prior to this, I obtained my MSc on Molecular Biology & Biotechnology at [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en) where I receive the Honours Collegue. Before that, I did my Bachelor at the [Univeridad Autónoma de Madrid](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio).
* Beyond my interest in ML and infectious diseases, I am also very interested in the application of new language ML models in the field of meta-analysis and meta-research.
